👋 Hi, I’m @Jiregna-Olani
👀 I’m interested in applying biostatistics and clinical epidemiology to design innovative solutions for healthcare challenges, with a focus on evidence-based decision-making and improving patient outcomes.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced statistical modeling, machine learning applications in healthcare, and interdisciplinary research techniques for healthcare innovation.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
International research projects in biostatistics, clinical trials, and health policy.
Interdisciplinary studies combining data science, cardiology, and biomedical engineering.
Public health initiatives aimed at improving healthcare systems in low- and middle-income countries.

⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not analyzing data or working on healthcare innovations, you can find me exploring scenic hiking trails, cooking traditional Ethiopian dishes, or immersing myself in the history and culture of different countries.
